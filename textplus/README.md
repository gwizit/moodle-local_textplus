## Installation

### Method 1: Via Moodle Plugin Installer (Recommended)

1. Download the plugin ZIP file
2. Log in to your Moodle site as an administrator
3. Go to **Site administration** → **Plugins** → **Install plugins**
4. Upload the ZIP file
5. **If prompted** with "Unable to detect the plugin type":
   - Select **"Local plugin (local)"** from the "Plugin type" dropdown
   - Confirm the plugin folder name shows as **"textplus"**
6. Click "Install plugin from the ZIP file"
7. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation

**Note**: Some Moodle installations require manual plugin type selection for security. This is normal behavior.

### Method 2: Manual Installation (If ZIP upload fails)

**Recommended if you get "corrupted_archive_structure" error:**

1. Extract the plugin ZIP file
2. Copy the `textplus` folder to `[moodle-root]/local/`
3. Log in to your Moodle site as an administrator
4. Navigate to **Site administration** → **Notifications**
5. Click **"Upgrade Moodle database now"**
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation

**Tip**: On Windows, you can use the included `manual_install.ps1` helper script.

### Method 3: Via Command Line

```bash
cd [moodle-root]/local/
git clone [repository-url] textplus
cd [moodle-root]
php admin/cli/upgrade.php
```

### Post-Installation: Clear Caches

**IMPORTANT:** After installing or updating the plugin, always clear Moodle's caches:

**Method 1: Via Web Interface**
1. Go to **Site administration** → **Development** → **Purge all caches**
2. Click "Purge all caches" button

**Method 2: Via Command Line (Faster)**
```bash
php admin/cli/purge_caches.php
```

**Why?** Moodle caches language strings. If you don't clear caches, you might see text displayed as `[[stringname]]` instead of the actual text. This is normal Moodle behavior for all plugins.

---

## Configuration

After installation, configure the plugin defaults:

1. Go to **Site administration** → **Plugins** → **Local plugins** → **TextPlus**
2. Configure the following settings:
   - **Default search term**: Default text to search for in database
   - **Default execution mode**: Dry Run or Execute (Dry Run recommended for safety)
   - **Search database by default**: Enable database searching (should be enabled)

---

## Usage

### Accessing the Tool

1. Log in as a **site administrator** (requires `moodle/site:config` capability)
2. Go to **Site administration** → **Server** → **TextPlus**

**Note:** Non-administrators will see an access denied error. This is intentional for security.

### Using the Multi-Step Wizard

#### Step 1: Define Search Criteria

1. **Enter Search Text**: Type the exact text string to search for
   - Simple text: `old company name`, `deprecated link`, `outdated information`
   - Case sensitive search option available
   
2. **Search Options**: Configure search parameters
   - Enable/disable case-sensitive search
   - Select which database tables to search
   - Documents (DOC, DOCX, ODT, TXT)
   - Videos (MP4, AVI, MOV, WebM)

3. Click **Find matching text** to proceed to Step 2

#### Step 2: Select Content to Replace

1. **Review Found Items**: See all database records containing your search text
   - Shows table name, field, record ID, and context
   - Preview of the text content with search term highlighted
   - Information about where the content appears (course, activity, etc.)

2. **Select Items**: 
   - Use checkboxes to select specific items to update
   - Use **Select All/Deselect All** buttons for bulk selection
   - Review each item carefully before selection

3. **Navigation**:
   - Click **Back** to modify search criteria
   - Click **Next** to proceed to replacement options

**Note:** At least one item must be selected to proceed.

#### Step 3: Replacement Options and Confirmation

1. **Enter Replacement Text**: 
   - Type the new text that will replace the search term
   - Leave empty to remove the search text completely
   - The replacement will maintain HTML formatting where applicable

2. **Configure Options**:
   - **Execution mode**: 
     - **Dry run**: See what would be changed without modifying the database (safe - recommended first)
     - **Execute changes**: Actually perform the replacements

3. **Database Backup Confirmation** ⚠️:
   - ☑️ **I confirm that a recent database backup has been made** (REQUIRED)
   - This checkbox must be checked before proceeding
   - Replacement operations cannot be undone

4. **Final Warning**: Read the warning about irreversible changes

5. Click **Execute Replacement** to complete the operation

### After Execution

- View detailed results showing success/failure for each item
- Review replacement log with statistics
- Click **Start Over** to begin a new replacement operation
- Consider clearing Moodle caches after replacements

### Database Tables Searched

The plugin searches text content in the following Moodle tables:
- `course` - Course names, descriptions, summaries
- `course_sections` - Course section summaries
- `page` - Page content
- `label` - Label text
- `book_chapters` - Book chapter content
- `forum_posts` - Forum post content
- `quiz` - Quiz descriptions
- `assign` - Assignment descriptions
- And other activity tables

**Third-Party Plugin Support:**
- **Edwiser RemUI Page Builder** - Automatically detected and included if installed
  - `edwiser_remui_pages` - Custom page titles and content

---

## How It Works

1. **Search Phase**: The plugin scans selected database tables for text content containing your search term
2. **Analysis**: For each matching record, it determines:
   - Table and field location
   - Record context (course, activity, etc.)
   - Content preview
3. **Replacement**: The search text is:
   - Replaced with the new text in selected records
   - HTML formatting is preserved
   - Character encoding is maintained
4. **Database Updates**: For database records:
   - Records are updated with new text content
   - Timestamps are updated appropriately
   - Data integrity is maintained
5. **Logging**: All operations are logged for audit purposes

---

## Permissions

The plugin defines two capabilities and requires site administrator access:

- **`moodle/site:config`**: **REQUIRED** - Site administrator permission (checked before any access)
- **`local/textplus:view`**: View the TextPlus tool
- **`local/textplus:manage`**: Perform text replacement operations

**Security Note:** Only users with site administrator permissions can access this plugin. Non-administrators will see an error message directing them to contact their site administrator.

---

## Security Features

### Access Control
- Site administrator-only access (`moodle/site:config` capability required)
- Multiple permission checks throughout the workflow
- Session key verification on all form submissions

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- All user input validated and sanitized by Moodle form API
- Search text validated with `PARAM_TEXT` to prevent SQL injection
- Database record IDs validated as integers with `PARAM_INT`
- All text content escaped before database queries
- Text input sanitized before display

### Output Protection
- All displayed content escaped with `s()` function to prevent XSS
- JavaScript strings escaped with `addslashes_js()`
- HTML output uses Moodle's `html_writer` class
- Search terms and replacement text sanitized before display

### Database Query Protection
- Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection
- All database operations use Moodle's DML API
- Record validation before updates
- Transaction support for data integrity

### Mandatory Backup Confirmation
- Checkbox confirmation required before executing replacements
- Warning message displayed about irreversible operations
- User must acknowledge database backup has been made

## Best Practices

### Safety First
1. ✅ Always run in **Dry Run mode** first to see what will be changed
2. ✅ **BACKUP YOUR DATABASE** before running replacements
3. ✅ Use the backup confirmation checkbox consciously - it's there for a reason
4. ✅ Test with a specific search term on a small set of content first
5. ✅ Review the content selection list carefully in Step 2 before proceeding
6. ✅ Consider running a test on a staging/development environment first

### Performance
1. ⚡ For large sites, use specific search terms to limit matches
2. ⚡ Run operations during low-traffic periods
3. ⚡ Process content in smaller batches if you have many matches
4. ⚡ Increase PHP memory limit for large batch operations
5. ⚡ Consider database optimization after large replacements

### Text Replacement
1. 📝 Use exact text strings for search terms
2. 📝 Double-check replacement text for typos before executing
3. 📝 Be aware of case sensitivity settings
4. 📝 Consider HTML formatting when replacing text in rich content
5. 📝 Test replacement on a few items before bulk operations

### Workflow
1. 📋 **Step 1**: Start with specific search terms, then broaden if needed
2. 📋 **Step 2**: Carefully review and select only the content you intend to update
3. 📋 **Step 3**: Always check "Dry Run mode" first, then run again in "Execute mode"
4. 📋 Document what you've changed for future reference
5. 📋 Clear Moodle caches after completing replacements
